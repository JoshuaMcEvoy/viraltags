# Gentle Raven
### Group Project [2] in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Course - Sydney, WDi23
Gentle Raven is an interactive data visualization using WebGl Globe that displays recent tweets in any location that a user searches for on a 3D global map. Once a search has been entered, the user can zoom into any point on the map and inspect where and what people are tweeting from that location.
